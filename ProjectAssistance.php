                    <p>Develops computational thinking and programming competencies:
                        Computational thinking can be described as a thought process that involves formulating a
                        problem, finding its solution in a logical and algorithmic way, such that any machine or human
                        can carry it out step by step, and, finally effectively executing the solution and evaluating
                        it. Programming encourages one to think in a computational manner such that they can solve
                        problems easily and efficiently. In fact, a robotics workshop using coding and programming can
                        go a long way in developing parts of the brain responsible for memory, concentration and foreign
                        languages, which will further help acquire more skills.
