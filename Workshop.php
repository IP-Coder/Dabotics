                    <p>School Education today encompasses a variety of tools, workshops and learning techniques. To
                        impart the vision of all-round development and overall enhancement of analytical, thinking and
                        critical skills in students. There are many clubs running in schools for this purpose and one of
                        the most successful learning tools has been imparting Robotics workshop to students in school. A
                        Robotics workshop is not just about creating Robots or making things that can move through a
                        remote control. These workshops use the Robots as an exciting tool to deliver many key concepts
                        and learning outcomes of the education curriculum. Let us have a look at some of these aspects
                        of a robotics workshop.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Supports STEM education:
                        A robotics workshop works on the concept of STEM education (Science, Engineering, Technology,
                        Maths). STEM education encourages a hands-on learning approach in an interdisciplinary and
                        applied format. Students understand various topics from the real worlds as concepts not of any
                        individual subject but as a cohesive, integrated learning approach. A Robotics workshop uses
                        Robots to teach the concepts of electronics and electricity to students. They also learn about
                        the mechanics by the way of the motion of robots and different parts of it. This also makes way
                        for the learning of various physical and mathematical concepts.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Robotics workshop should be project based:
                        Students learn various subjects not from books or even through guided activities, but by
                        designing their own Robots. A good robotics workshop should follow the makerâ€™s approach and
                        students should be developing their own models through their own hands. Students should be given
                        projects where they need to identify solutions to problems that present themselves during the
                        course of the project. This encourages problem-solving approach among students and is a good
                        exercise for developing team dynamics and team building skills as well.
